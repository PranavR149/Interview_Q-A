# Project Description
This project involves creating an interactive web application that assists users in preparing for SQL interviews using advanced AI models. The application leverages LangChain's ChatGroq model, particularly the "Llama3-8b-8192," to generate accurate, context-based answers to SQL-related questions. Users can input their questions, and the model provides precise responses based on a single document related to SQL interviews. The application employs Google Generative AI Embeddings and FAISS to embed and store the document for efficient retrieval. The document is ingested, split into smaller chunks, and embedded to facilitate quick access and similarity search. The user-friendly interface, built with Streamlit, allows users to seamlessly interact with the application, making it a valuable tool for SQL interview preparation.
